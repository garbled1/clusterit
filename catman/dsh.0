     The ddsshh utility can be used to run a command, or group of commands on a
     cluster of machines.  All commands are run in parallel, on the cluster.
     Interrupt signals will be sent to the remote host that is currently being
     displayed to the user.  The following options are available:

     --ee   Unless the --ee option is specified, stderr from remote commands will
          not be reported to the user.

     --ii   The --ii option will list information about the current cluster, and
          command groupings.  It will print out the current value of the
          fanout, and how many groups of machines there are within the clus-
          ter. It will also show you which command you are about to run, and
          your username if specified with the --ll option.

     --qq   The --qq option does not issue any commands, but displays information
          about the cluster, and the fanout groupings.

     --ff   If the --ff option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the
          fanout size of the cluster.  The fanout size is the number of nodes
          a command will run on in parallel at one time.  Thus a 80 node clus-
          ter, with a fanout size of 64, would run 64 nodes in parallel, then,
          when all have finished, it would execute the command on the last 16
          nodes.  The fanout size defaults to 64.  This option overrides the
          FANOUT environment variable.

     --gg   If the --gg option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of
          group names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A
          node may be a part of more than one group if desired, however run-
          ning without the --gg option will run the command on the same node as
          many times as it appears in the file specified by the CLUSTER envi-
          ronment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
          --ww option.

     --ll   If the --ll option is specified, followed by a username, the commands
          will be run under that userid on the remote machines.  Consideration
          must be taken for proper authentication, for this to work.

     --ww   If the --ww option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of
          machine names, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be run on each node in the list.
          Without this option, ddsshh runs on the nodes listed in the file point-
          ed to by the CLUSTER environment variable.

     --xx   The --xx option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the clus-
          ter.  The format is the same as the --ww option, a comma delimited
          list of machine names.  This option is silently ignored if used with
          the --ww option.

     ddsshh utilizes the following environment variables.

     CLUSTER   Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
               in the cluster.

     RCMD_CMD  Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command cho-
               sen must be able to connect with no password to the remote

               host.  Defaults to rrsshh

     FANOUT    When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent
               at once.  This can be used to keep from overloading a small
               host when sending out commands in parallel.  Defaults to 64.
               This environment setting can be overridden by the --ff option.

FFIILLEESS
     The file pointed to by the CLUSTER environment variable has the following
     format:

           pollux
           castor
           GROUP:alpha
           rigel
           kent
           GROUP:sparc
           alshain
           altair
           LUMP:alphasparc
           alpha
           sparc

     This example would have pollux and castor a member of no groups, rigel
     and kent a member of group 'alpha', and alshain and altair a member of
     group `sparc'. Note the format of the GROUP command, it is in all capital
     letters, followed by a colon, and the group name.  There can be no spaces
     following the GROUP command, or in the name of the group.

     There is also a LUMP command, which is identical in syntax to the GROUP
     command.  This command allows you to create a named group of groups.
     Each member of the lump is the name of a group.  The LUMP command is ter-
     minated by another LUMP or GROUP command, or the EOF marker.

     The command:

           dsh hostname

     will display:

           pollux: pollux
           castor: castor

     if the file pointed to by CLUSTER contains:

           pollux
           castor

     The command:

           dsh -w hadar,rigel hostname

     will display:

           hadar:  hadar
           rigel:  rigel

     The ddsshh command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the ddsshh command
     in IBM PSSP.

AAUUTTHHOORR
     DDsshh was written by Tim Rightnour.

BBUUGGSS
     Solaris 2.5.1 has a maximum of 256 open file descriptors.  This means
     that ddsshh will fail on a fanout size greater than about 32-40 nodes.
