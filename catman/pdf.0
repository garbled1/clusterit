     ppddff displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the speci-
     fied _f_i_l_e___s_y_s_t_e_m or on the file system of which _f_i_l_e is a part on all ma-
     chines in a cluster.  If neither a file or a _f_i_l_e___s_y_s_t_e_m operand is spec-
     ified, statistics for all mounted file systems, on all machines are dis-
     played (subject to the --ww, --xx, --gg, --mm, --ll and --tt options below).  The
     following options are available:

     --ll   Display statistics only about mounted file systems with the MNT_LO-
          CAL flag set.  If a non-local file system is given as an argument, a
          warning is issued and no information is given on that file system.

     --nn   Print out the previously obtained statistics from the file systems.
          This option should be used if it is possible that one or more file
          systems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
          statistics without a long delay.  When this option is specified, ppddff
          will not request new statistics from the file systems, but will re-
          spond with the possibly stale statistics that were previously ob-
          tained.

     --gg   If the --gg option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of
          group names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A
          node may be a part of more than one group if desired, however run-
          ning without the --gg option will run the command on the same node as
          many times as it appears in the file specified by the CLUSTER envi-
          ronment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
          --ww option.

     --mm _s_i_z_e
          Is used to limit the displayed file systems to only those with a
          size greater than the user-supplied _s_i_z_e argument.

     --tt _t_y_p_e
          Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on filesystems
          of the specified type.  More than one type may be specified in a
          comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be prefixed
          with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types for which action should
          _n_o_t be taken.  If a file system is given on the command line that is
          not of the specified type, a warning is issued and no information is
          given on that file system.

     --ww   If the --ww option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of
          machine names, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be run on each node in the list.
          Without this flag, ppddff runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed
          to by the CLUSTER environment variable.

     --xx   The --xx option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the clus-
          ter.  The format is the same as the --ww option, a comma delimited
          list of machine names.  This option is silently ignored if used with
          the --ww option.

     ppddff utilizes the following environment variables.

     CLUSTER   Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
               in the cluster.

     RCMD_CMD  Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command cho-
               sen must be able to connect with no password to the remote
               host.  Defaults to rrsshh

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     dsh(1), df(1), rsh(1), kerberos(3), hosts.equiv(5), rhosts(5)

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ppddff command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the ppddff command
     in IBM PSSP.

AAUUTTHHOORR
     PPddff was written by Tim Rightnour.

     Output is formatted for 80 columns.  This means that mount points and
     filesystems with long names (> 20 characters) will be truncated.  In ad-
     dition, numbers longer than 9 digits will be truncated as well.

     ppddff will only work on nodes that produce the df(1) output that it ex-
     pects.  It has been made to work on HP-UX, Solaris, and AIX, along with
     any BSD.
