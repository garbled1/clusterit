     The jjsshh program connects to a _j_s_d daemon, and requests a node for pro-
     cessing.  It will then connect to that remote node and execute the com-
     mand or commands given to it.  Once it has completed work on the remote
     machine, it will return the node to the _j_s_d daemon for future use by
     other jjsshh processes.  The primary use of this is to ensure that no more
     than one remote process is running on any single machine at a point in
     time.  This can be used to better facilitate bulk parallel compiling.

     The following options are available:

     --aa   The --aa option modifies the behavior of jjsshh when dealing with stdin.
          Normally all commands from stdin are run on the same machine.  Spec-
          ifying the --aa option causes each command to be run on the next node
          in the seqence.

     --ee   Unless the --ee option is specified, stderr from remote commands will
          not be reported to the user.

     --ii   The --ii option will list information about the current cluster, and
          command groupings. It will also show you which command you are about
          to run, and your username if specified with the --ll option.

     --vv   Prints the version of ClusterIt to the stdout, and exits.

     --ll   If the --ll option is specified, followed by a username, the commands
          will be run under that userid on the remote machines.  Consideration
          must be taken for proper authentication, for this to work.

     --pp   The --pp option can be used to set the port number which jsd will lis-
          ten to replies from jjsshh processes indicating completion of process-
          ing on remote nodes.  This option overrides the JSD_IPORT environ-
          ment variable.  The default listen port is 2001.

     --oo   The --oo option can be used to set the port number which jsd will lis-
          ten to requests from jjsshh processes for remote nodes.  This option
          overrides the JSD_OPORT environment variable.  The default listen
          port is 2002.

     --hh   The --hh option can be used to set the remote hostname where a _j_s_d
          daemon is running.  jjsshh defaults to contacting a _j_s_d daemon on the
          local machine, but can be set up to talk to a remote daemon.  The --hh
          option will override the JSD_HOST environment variable.

     jjsshh utilizes the following environment variables:

     RCMD_CMD       Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command
                    chosen must be able to connect with no password to the
                    remote host.  Defaults to rrsshh.

     RCMD_CMD_ARGS  Arguments to pass to the remote shell command.  Defaults
                    to none.

     JSD_OPORT      When set, overrides the default port which jsd listens on
                    for jjsshh processes requesting nodes.  This environment set-
                    ting can be overriden by the --oo option.

     JSD_IPORT      When set, overrides the default port which jsd listens on
                    for jjsshh processes reporting back that it has completed
                    processing on a node.  This environment setting can be
                    overriden by the --pp option.

     JSD_HOST       When set, contains the hostname of the remote machine that
                    the _j_s_d daemon is listening on.  This environment setting
                    can be overriden by the --hh option.
