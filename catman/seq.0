     The sseeqq utility can be used to run a command, or group of commands on a
     cluster of machines.  The command or commands are run on a single node in
     the cluster, which is incremented in sequence on each invocation of sseeqq
     The following options are available:

     --aa   The --aa option modifies the behavior of seq when dealing with stdin.
          Normally all commands from stdin are run on the same machine.  Spec-
          ifying the --aa option causes each command to be run on the next node
          in the seqence.

     --ee   Unless the --ee option is specified, stderr from remote commands will
          not be reported to the user.

     --ii   The --ii option will list information about the current cluster, and
          command groupings.  It will also show you which command you are
          about to run, and your username if specified with the --ll option.

     --qq   The --qq option does not issue any commands, but displays information
          about the cluster.

     --gg   If the --gg option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of
          group names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A
          node may be a part of more than one group if desired, however run-
          ning without the --gg option will run the command on the same node as
          many times as it appears in the file specified by the CLUSTER envi-
          ronment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
          --ww option.

     --ll   If the --ll option is specified, followed by a username, the commands
          will be run under that userid on the remote machines.  Consideration
          must be taken for proper authentication, for this to work.

     --ww   If the --ww option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of
          machine names, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be run on each node in the list.
          Without this option, sseeqq runs on the nodes listed in the file point-
          ed to by the CLUSTER environment variable.

     --xx   The --xx option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the clus-
          ter.  The format is the same as the --ww option, a comma delimited
          list of machine names.  This option is silently ignored if used with
          the --ww option.

     sseeqq utilizes the following environment variables.

     CLUSTER   Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
               in the cluster.

     RCMD_CMD  Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command cho-
               sen must be able to connect with no password to the remote
               host.  Defaults to rrsshh

     SEQ_FILE  Specifies a specific sequence file.  This is a temporary file,
               which saves the number of the last node run on.  It defaults to
               _/_t_m_p_/[pid].seq. Where [pid] is the pid of the parent process of
               sseeqq. It may be useful to wire the SEQ_FILE to a particular
               file, in order to keep proper sequence when invoking sseeqq from
               subshells or scripts.

     Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

     The sseeqq command appeared in clusterit 1.1.

     SSeeqq was written by Tim Rightnour.

     The sseeqq command works fine when used with the --ww and --xx flags.  However
     the user may find that if the arguments are changed, or the flags are
     omitted on a subsequent run, the next node picked may not be predictable.
     The sequence is calculated on each invocation of sseeqq and the sequence
     numbers recorded in the temporary file may not match up to a new sequence
     placed on the command line.
