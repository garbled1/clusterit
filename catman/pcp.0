     The ppccpp utility can be used to copy a file, or directory to a group of
     machines.  The group of machines can be listed on the command line, or
     default to the environment setting CLUSTER The following options are
     available:

     --cc   Normally ppccpp copies files serially, to all the nodes specified.
          When the --cc option is used, ppccpp will copy the files in parallel to
          the nodes, subject to the FANOUT environment setting and --ff option.
          Smaller files will benefit greatly from parallel copies, due to re-
          duced latency in the initial authentication, and connection.  Howev-
          er, large files, especially on a shared ethernet, will suffer
          tremendous speed degredation, because of the collisions the trans-
          fers will create.  This effect can be reduced, by lowering the
          fanout size of the cluster.

     --ee   Unless the --ee option is specified, output from remote commands will
          not be reported to the user.

     --pp   The --pp option causes ppccpp to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its
          copies the modification times and modes of the source files, ignor-
          ing the _u_m_a_s_k. By default, the mode and owner of _f_i_l_e_2 are preserved
          if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file modi-
          fied by the umask(2) on the destination host is used.

     --rr   If any of the source files are directories, ppccpp copies each subtree
          rooted at that name; in this case the destination must be a directo-
          ry.

     --ff   If the --ff option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the
          fanout size of the cluster.  The fanout size is the number of nodes
          a command will run on in parallel at one time.  Thus a 80 node clus-
          ter, with a fanout size of 64, would run 64 nodes in parallel, then,
          when all have finished, it would execute the command on the last 16
          nodes.  The fanout size defaults to 64.  This option overrides the
          FANOUT environment variable.

     --gg   If the --gg option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of
          group names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A
          node may be a part of more than one group if desired, however run-
          ning without the --gg option will run the command on the same node as
          many times as it appears in the file specified by the CLUSTER envi-
          ronment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
          --ww option.

     --ww   If the --ww option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of
          machine names, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be run on each node in the list.
          Without this flag, ppccpp runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed
          to by the CLUSTER environment variable.

     --xx   The --xx option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the clus-
          ter.  The format is the same as the --ww option, a comma delimited
          list of machine names.  This option is silently ignored if used with
          the --ww option.

     ppccpp utilizes the following environment variables.

     CLUSTER  Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
              in the cluster.

     RCP_CMD  Command to use to copy files to remote machines.  The command
              chosen must be able to connect with no password to the remote
              host.  Defaults to rrccpp

     FANOUT   When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent
              at once.  This can be used to keep from overloading a small host
              when sending out commands in parallel.  Defaults to 64.  This
              environment setting can be overridden by the --ff option.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     The command:

     pcp file

     will copy the file 'file' to the home directory of the current user on
     all machines listed in the file pointed to by the CLUSTER environment
     setting.

     The command:

     pcp -w hadar,rigel file

     will copy the file 'file' to the home directory of the current user on
     the machines 'hadar' and 'rigel'.

     The command:

     pcp -w hadar,rigel /usr/bin/foo /usr/local/bin/foo

     will copy the file '/usr/bin/foo' to '/usr/local/bin/foo' on the machines
     'hadar' and 'rigel'.

     The ppccpp command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the ppccpp command
     in IBM PSSP.

     PPccpp was written by Tim Rightnour.
