     The bbaarrrriieerr command can be used to syncronize execution of various com-
     mands.  When a barrier is set, it is not released until all the nodes or
     processes have met the barrier condition.  This can be a handy way to
     make sure slower machines, perform certain tasks before doing something
     on faster machines that relies on them. The following options are avail-
     able:

     --qq   Turns quiet off, so barrier notifications are sent to the user.

     --hh   Specifies a host, which is running barrierd, to connect to for bar-
          rier syncronization.  Overrides the BARRIER_HOST environment vari-
          able.

     --kk   Specifies a unique key to syncronize with.  A barrier will only syn-
          chronize with other barriers that share the same key.  Defaults to
          the string 'barrier'.

     --pp   Specifies a port number of a remote barrier daemon to connect to.
          Defaults to 1933, and overrides the BARRIER_PORT environment vari-
          able.

     --ss   Sets the size of the cluster.  A barrier condition is met, when the
          number of barrier clients connected to the remote daemon, sharing
          the same unique key, is equal to this number.

     BARRIER_HOST  Sets the default remote host to connect to.

     Exit status is 0 on successful syncronization.  Exit status will be set
     to 1 if the connection is lost, or the server rejects your connection.
