DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The rrvvtt program is a VT100 terminal emulator for X.  It is intended as a
     partial replacement for xterm(1) for users who do not require the more
     esoteric features of xterm(1).  Specifically rrvvtt does not implement the
     Tektronix 4014 emulation, session logging and toolkit style configurabil-
     ity. As a result, rrvvtt uses much less swap space than xterm(1), a signifi-
     cant advantage on a machine serving many X sessions.

     The rrvvtt program is based on the xvt(1) terminal emulator.  However, it
     has been modified specificly for use with the dvt(1) program.  It may be
     used as a stand-alone application, but it is not suggested that the user
     do so. The following options are available:

     --ll _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
          If the program specified by the RLOGIN_CMD environment variable al-
          lows the user to pass a username with a --ll option (Such as some
          versions of rsh(1) or ssh(1)) then the rrvvtt program will pass the ap-
          propriate flags to the remote-connection command to attempt to con-
          nect to the remote machine as the username specified.

     --ddiissppllaayy _d_i_s_p_l_a_y_-_n_a_m_e
          Attempt to open the rrvvtt window on the named X display.  In the ab-
          sence of this option, the display specified by the DISPLAY environ-
          ment variable will be used.

     --ggeeoommeettrryy _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
          Create the window with the specified X window geometry.

     --bbaacckkggrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r
          Use the specified color as the window's background color.

     --bbgg _c_o_l_o_r
          This option is a synonym for --bbaacckkggrroouunndd

     --ffoorreeggrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r
          Use the specified color as the window's foreground color.

     --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
          This option is a synonym for --ffoorreeggrroouunndd

     --bbdd _c_o_l_o_r
          Set the border color.  As with border width, this option will usual-
          ly be disregarded with respect to the window's outer border.  It
          does, however, set the color of the line separating the scroll bar
          from the main part of the window.

     --bbww _n_u_m_b_e_r
          Set the window border width to _n_u_m_b_e_r pixels.  Many window managers
          ignore existing window borders and contruct their own.  If you are
          using such a window manager, this option will be ignored.

     --ffoonntt _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e
          Set the main text font to be used by rrvvtt

     --ffbb _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e
          Set the font used for the vt100 bold rendition style.  Unlike
          xterm(1), the current version of rrvvtt will not try and create bold
          text by displacing and or'ing an ordinary font.  Therefore if you
          want bold highlighting to work, you need to use this option to spec-
          ify a suitable bold font.

     --nnaammee _n_a_m_e
          Set the name that is used when looking up X resource values for this
          instance of .

     --ssll _n_u_m_b_e_r
          Set an upper bound for the number of lines of text that will be
          saved when they have scrolled off the top of the window.

     --cccc _c_h_a_r_-_c_l_a_s_s
          Input or modify the character classes that are used to determine
          what is a word when a double-click is used to select a word of dis-
          played text.  This is identical to the same option in xterm(1).  See
          the xterm(1) manual page for a description of the syntax of _s_t_r_i_n_g.

     --ssbb  Start up with the scrollbar visible.  The scrollbar can be displayed
          or hidden at any time, simply by holding down the CONTROL key on the
          keyboard and pressing any mouse button.  The visibility of the
          scrollbar does not determine whether scrolled text is saved or not,
          as with xterm(1), text scrolled off the top of the window is always
          saved up to the current maximum number of lines.

     --rrww  Enable reverse wrapping of the cursor, so that lines typed to a
          shell that are longer than the width of the screen can be edited.
          This is the same as the xterm(1) reverse wrap option.

     --mmssgg
          Enable messages to the terminal window from programs like write(1).
          By default, rrvvtt windows have messages disabled.  Executing an rrvvtt
          window with the --mmssgg option has the same effect as running it nor-
          mally, and executing the command `mesg y' to enable messages.

     --iiccoonniicc
          Start up with the window already iconized.  _r_e_m_o_t_e_-_m_a_c_h_i_n_e The name
          of a remote machine to connect to.  The connection attempt is made
          via the program specified by the RLOGIN_CMD environment variable.

XX RREESSOOUURRCCEESS
     Most of the command line options have X resource counterparts and these
     are listed in the following table.  Like xterm(1), rrvvtt uses the class
     name XTerm, so resource options set for XTerm will work for both xterm(1)
     and rrvvtt windows.

     Lines of text that scroll off the top of the rrvvtt window are saved auto-
     matically (up to a preset maximum number) and can be viewed by scrolling
     them back into the window with the scrollbar.  The scrollbar itself can
     be displayed or hidden by clicking any mouse button in the window while
     holding down the CONTROL key on the keyboard.  When using the scrollbar,
     the left and right mouse buttons are used for scrolling by a few lines at
     a time and the middle button is used for continuous scrolling.  To use
     the middle button, press it in the scroll bar and hold it down. The cen-
     tral shaded part of the scrollbar will then attach itself to the cursor
     and can be slid up or down to show different parts of the sequence of
     saved lines.  When scrolling with the left and right buttons, the left
     button is used to scroll up and the right is used to scroll down. Assum-
     ing that there are enough hidden lines, the distance scrolled with either
     button is equal to the number of lines between the cursor and the top of
     the window. Hence, pressing the left cursor opposite a line of text will
     result in that line being moved to be the top of the window and pressing
     the right button will cause the top line to be moved down so that it is
     opposite the cursor.

     RRvvtt uses the same kind of text selection and insertion mechanism as
     xterm(1).  Pressing and releasing the middle mouse button in an rrvvtt win-
     dow causes the current text selection to be inserted as if it had been
     typed on the keyboard. For the insertion to take place, both the button
     press and the button release need to be done with the cursor in the rrvvtt
     window.

     The left and right mouse buttons are used to select text, with the left
     button being used to start a selection and the right button being used to
     modify an existing selection. Any continuous block of displayed text can
     be selected. If both ends of the text block are visible in the window
     then the easiest way to select it is to position the cursor at one end
     and press the left mouse button, then drag the cursor to the other end
     with the button held down before releasing the button. If the block is
     larger than the window then you must first use the left mouse button to
     select one end, then use the scroll bar to scroll the other end into view
     and finally use the right mouse button to extend the selection. The ef-
     fect of pressing the right mouse button is to move the nearest end of the
     current selection to the current cursor position.

     The other way to make selections in rrvvtt is to use double and triple
     clicks of the left mouse button with a double click selecting a word and
     a triple click selecting a whole line. For this purpose, a word is a se-
     quence of characters in the same class.  The default character classes
     are:

          ++oo   The upper and lower case letters, digits and `_' (underscore)
              all in one class;

          ++oo   The white space characters all in one class;

          ++oo   Each of the remaining punctuation characters in a class by it-
              self.

     If you want to change the character classes so that, for example, you can
     select a UNIX pathname or a mail address in one double click, then you
     can do so by using the --cccc command line option or the _c_h_a_r_C_l_a_s_s X re-
     source.  Multiple clicking can be combined with dragging to select a se-
     quence of consecutive words or lines.

     Although rrvvtt essentially mimics the behaviour of xterm(1) in its support
     of text selection and insertion, there are a couple of minor differences:

          ++oo   rrvvtt respects TAB characters in selected text and does not auto-
              matically convert them into spaces as does xterm(1);

          ++oo   rrvvtt will let you abort a text insertion if you realize you have
              made a mistake before releasing the middle mouse button.

     rrvvtt utilizes the following environment variables.

     DISPLAY     The default X server that the client should connect to.

     RLOGIN_CMD  The default command that will be run to connect to the remote
                 host.  This can be anything from rsh(1), ssh(1), to telnet(1)
                 because rvt is an interactive process, automatic authentica-
                 tion is not required as it is with dsh(1).

     RRvvtt is based on the program xvt(1) written by John Bovey, University of
     Kent, in 1992.  Modifications to make this program compile on modern ma-
     chines, and work with dvt(1) were made by Tim Rightnour.
