     The pprrmm utility can be used to delete files or directories on a cluster
     of machines.  The following options are available:

     --ww   If the --ww option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of
          machine names, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be run on each node in the list.
          Without this flag, pprrmm runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed
          to by the CLUSTER environment variable.

     --gg   If the --gg option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of
          group names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A
          node may be a part of more than one group if desired, however run-
          ning without the --gg option will run the command on the same node as
          many times as it appears in the file specified by the CLUSTER envi-
          ronment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
          --ww option.

     --xx   The --xx option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the clus-
          ter.  The format is the same as the --ww option, a comma delimited
          list of machine names.  This option is silently ignored if used with
          the --ww option.

     --dd   Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.

     --ff   Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation, re-
          gardless of the file's permissions.  If the file does not exist, do
          not display a diagnostic message or modify the exit status to re-
          flect an error.

     --PP   Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten
          three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then
          0xff again, before they are deleted.

     --RR   Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.
          The --RR option implies the --dd option.

     --rr   Equivalent to --RR.

     --WW   Attempts to undelete the named files.  Currently, this option can
          only be used to recover files covered by whiteouts.

     pprrmm utilizes the following environment variables.

     CLUSTER   Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
               in the cluster.

     RCMD_CMD  Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command cho-
               sen must be able to connect with no password to the remote
               host.  Defaults to rrsshh

     Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

     dsh(1),  rm(1),  rsh(1),  kerberos(3),  hosts.equiv(5),  rhosts(5)

     The pprrmm command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the pprrmm command
     in IBM PSSP.

     PPrrmm was written by Tim Rightnour.

     Error handling could use some work.

     Some of the more advanced options, like the --PP option, may not be avail-
     able in some versions of rm(1).  Consult the rm(1) manpage on the remote
     host if you have problems.
