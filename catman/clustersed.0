     The cclluusstteerrsseedd program is used to cut individual groups out of a cluster
     file.  This can be used to see the contents of a particular group easily,
     or to generate special-use clusters on the fly. The results of the pro-
     gram will be sent to standard output.  The following options are avail-
     able:

     _c_l_u_s_t_e_r_f_i_l_e  The first argument must either be the name of a cluster
                  file, or a single dash (`-').  If the dash is given, the
                  clusterfile will be read from the file indicated in the
                  CLUSTER environment variable.  If the CLUSTER environment
                  variable does not exist, cclluusstteerrsseedd will process standard
                  input.

     _s_t_r_i_n_g       The second argument is a space separated list of one or more
                  strings to search for in the cluster file.  These are the
                  names of groups within the cluster, and will only match
                  group names.  If a group name is matched, all nodes in that
                  group will be printed out, along with the `GROUP:' heading
                  and the name of the group.  You can partially match the
                  begining of a group name with a string.  For example, the
                  argument `serv' would match `server1' and `server2' but
                  would not match `subserv'.

     cclluusstteerrsseedd utilizes the following environment variables:

     CLUSTER  Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
              in the cluster.
