DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ddttoopp command can be used to remotely monitor a cluster of machines
     for CPU and process information.  It provides the same information as the
     top program, but rather than showing it just for one machine, it gathers
     the information from a cluster of machines, and sorts it all together
     into a single, periodically updating report.  The following options are
     available:

     --bb   The --bb flag causes ddttoopp to run one iteration on each node, and print
          out a single report of the processes running on those nodes, rather
          than continuously updating.

     --mm   The --mm option determines if the output is process output, or load
          average output.  Load average output gives the load average, and
          memory usage statistics for the machines being monitored.  Process
          output gives a list of processes on each machine, sorted by cpu
          usage.  The default mode is proc.

     --ii   The --ii flag selects the interval of time between the update of each
          nodes process or load information.  It is not wise to set this value
          too low, otherwise you may produce uneccesary load on the target
          hosts.  The interval is specified in seconds.

     --ff   If the --ff option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the
          fanout size of the cluster.  The fanout size is the number of nodes
          a command will run on in parallel at one time.  Thus a 80 node clus-
          ter, with a fanout size of 64, would run 64 nodes in parallel, then,
          when all have finished, it would execute the command on the last 16
          nodes.  The fanout size defaults to 64.  This option overrides the
          FANOUT environment variable.

     --gg   If the --gg option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of
          group names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A
          node may be a part of more than one group if desired, however run-
          ning without the --gg option will run the command on the same node as
          many times as it appears in the file specified by the CLUSTER envi-
          ronment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
          --ww option.

     --ll   If the --ll option is specified, followed by a username, the commands
          will be run under that userid on the remote machines.  Consideration
          must be taken for proper authentication, for this to work.

     --oo   The --oo option is used to set the timeout in seconds to be used when
          testing remote connections.  The default is five seconds.

     --pp   The --pp option can be used to set the port number that testing should
          occur on when testing remote connections.  The default behavior is
          to guess based on the remote command name.

     --qq   The --qq option does not issue any commands, but displays information
          about the cluster, and the fanout groupings.

     --tt   The --tt option causes ddttoopp to attempt a connection test to each node
          prior to attempting to run the remote command.  If the test fails
          for any reason, the remote command will not be attempted.  This can
          be useful when clusterfiles have suffered bitrot and some nodes no
          longer exist, or might be down for maintenance.  The default timeout
          is 5 seconds.  The timeout can be changed with the --oo option.  ddttoopp
          will attempt to guess the port number of the remote service based on
          your RCMD_CMD setting.  It knows about ssh and rsh.  If ddttoopp fails
          to guess your port correctly, you may use the --pp argument to set the
          remote port number.  If the RCMD_TEST environment variable exists,
          the testing will automatically take place.

     --vv   Prints the version of ClusterIt to the stdout, and exits.

     --ww   If the --ww option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of
          machine names, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d will be run on each node in the list.
          Without this option, ddttoopp runs on the nodes listed in the file
          pointed to by the CLUSTER environment variable.

     --xx   The --xx option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the clus-
          ter.  The format is the same as the --ww option, a comma delimited
          list of machine names.  This option is silently ignored if used with
          the --ww option.

     ddttoopp utilizes the following environment variables.

     CLUSTER            Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list
                        of nodes in the cluster.

     RCMD_CMD           Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The
                        command chosen must be able to connect with no pass-
                        word to the remote host.  Defaults to rrsshh

     RCMD_CMD_ARGS      Arguments to pass to the remote shell command.
                        Defaults to none.

     RCMD_PORT          The port number used to test remote connections.  See
                        the --pp flag.

     RCMD_TEST          When set, ddttoopp will automatically test all hosts
                        before launching the remote command. See the --tt option
                        for more information.

     RCMD_TEST_TIMEOUT  The timeout in seconds to use when testing for remote
                        connections.

     RCMD_USER          The username to connect to remote machines as by
                        default.

     FANOUT             When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent com-
                        mands sent at once.  This can be used to keep from
                        overloading a small host when sending out commands in
                        parallel.  Defaults to 64.  This environment setting
                        can be overridden by the --ff option.

     When ddttoopp is running in interactive mode, it reads commands from the ter-
     minal and acts upon them accordingly.  During interactive mode, every few
     seconds, depending on the interval, ddttoopp will query the next few hosts in
     the cluster, and merge the data from those hosts into the display.  The
     number of hosts updated each interval, is determined by the fanout set-
     ting.

     Certain characters cause immediate action by ddttoopp.  These are

     pp           Switch the mode to the process mode, sorted by the CPU usage
                 of each process.

     mm           Switch the mode to the process mode, sorted by the memory
                 usage of each process.

     ll           Switch the mode to the load average mode, sorted by hostname.

     vv           Switch the mode to the load average mode, sorted by load
                 average.

     aa           Switch the mode to the load average mode, sorted by active
                 memory.

     ii           Switch the mode to the load average mode, sorted by inactive
                 memory.

     rr           Switch the mode to the load average mode, sorted by file
                 cache/buffer memory.

     ff           Switch the mode to the load average mode, sorted by free mem-
                 ory.

     ss           Switch the mode to the load average mode, sorted by swap
                 used.

     The file pointed to by the CLUSTER environment variable has the following
     format:

           pollux
           castor
           GROUP:alpha
           rigel
           kent
           GROUP:sparc
           alshain
           altair
           LUMP:alphasparc
           alpha
           sparc

     This example would have pollux and castor a member of no groups, rigel
     and kent a member of group 'alpha', and alshain and altair a member of
     group `sparc'.  Note the format of the GROUP command, it is in all capi-
     tal letters, followed by a colon, and the group name.  There can be no
     spaces following the GROUP command, or in the name of the group.

     There is also a LUMP command, which is identical in syntax to the GROUP
     command.  This command allows you to create a named group of groups.
     Each member of the lump is the name of a group.  The LUMP command is ter-
     minated by another LUMP or GROUP command, or the EOF marker.

     Any line beginning with a `#' symbol denotes a comment field, and the
     entire line will be ignored.  Note that a hash mark placed anywhere other
     than the first character of a line, will be considered part of a valid
     hostname or command.

     The ddttoopp command appeared in clusterit 2.5.  Work on ddttoopp was made possi-
     ble by a generous donation from Mach1 Computing, LLC.

AAUUTTHHOORR
     ddttoopp was written by Tim Rightnour.

BBUUGGSS
     Solaris 2.5.1 has a maximum of 256 open file descriptors.  This means
     that ddttoopp will fail on a fanout size greater than about 32-40 nodes.

     ddttoopp uses the top command in batch mode to collect data from remote
     machines.  Because of this, the top command must exist on the remote
     node, and additionally, ddttoopp must understand it's output.  ddttoopp should be
     able to understand output from top on NetBSD, Solaris, and Linux, how-
     ever, it is possible that if the format were to change, or be different,
     it would break.  If ddttoopp fails to work for you, please send the output
     of:

           top -Sb 20
     or

           top -bn 1

     to root@garbled.net, or file a bug report on sourceforge.

     ddttoopp is still rather new, and is likely to still have a few display bugs
     and parsing issues.
