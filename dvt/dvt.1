.Dt DVT 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm dvt
.Nd launch an interactive window on a cluster of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl eiq
.Op Fl f Ar fanout
.Op Fl g Ar rungroup1,...,rungroupN
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Op Fl w Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Op Fl x Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility launches a number of terminal windows, one for each machine the user
specifies on the command line.  In addition, it launches a single control
window.  The terminal windows are similar to terminal windows provided by
.Xr xterm 1 ,
.Xr xvt 1
or
.Xr rxvt 1
in most regards, and may be used as a standard terminal window by themselves.
The control window however, allows global control of all the terminal
windows.  The user can type in the command box of the control window,
and the keystrokes will be sent to all the terminal windows at once.
In this way the user can perform interactive commands, such as editing
a file, in parallel.  At any point, the user can switch his keyboard
focus to a particular window, and issue commands to that window only,
should it become neccesary.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl e
Unless the
.Fl e
option is specified, stderr from remote commands will not be reported to the
user.
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option will list information about the current cluster, and command groupings. 
It will print out the current value of the fanout, and how many groups of 
machines there are within the cluster. It will also show you which command 
you are about to run, and your username if specified with the
.Fl l
option.
.It Fl q
The
.Fl q
option does not issue any commands, but displays information about the 
cluster, and the fanout groupings.
.It Fl f
If the
.Fl f
option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the fanout size of the 
cluster.  The fanout size is the number of nodes a command will run on in 
parallel at one time.  The fanout option, restricts the maximum number
of windows that can be opened at one time.  This is used to prevent
the user from accidentally launching hundreds of windows, and crashing
their X-terminal, or server.  The fanout size defaults to 64.  This
option overrides the
.Ev FANOUT
environment variable.
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group names, the 
command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A node may be a part of 
more than one group if desired, however running without the
.Fl g
option will open windows to the same node as many times as it appears in the
file specified by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl l
If the
.Fl l
option is specified, followed by a username, the initial connection
attempted will pass the username argument and attempt to login with
that account to the remote system. Consideration must be taken for
proper authentication, for this to work.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
windows will be opened to each node in the list.  Without this option,
.Nm
open windows to all the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The format 
is the same as the
.Fl w
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is silently 
ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RVT_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RVT_CMD
Contains the name of a binary to be executed by
.Nm
which will open a terminal window and connection to a single remote
host.  The user may override this with another program that performs
the same function, however, the program must supply as it's only
output to stdout, it's X Window-ID in decimal.  In addition, it must
take as the final argument, the name of a remtoe machine to connect
to.  This program must also be capable of recieving X events sent via
the
.Xr XSendEvent 3
facility.  If this environment variable is not set, it defaults to
.Ic rvt
.It Ev FANOUT
When set, limits the maximum number of terminal windows to open
simultaneously.  This is designed to safeguard the user from
potentially opening hundreds of windows, and overloading the
X-terminal or server. Defaults to 64.  This environment setting can be
overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.El
.Sh FILES
The file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable has the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux
castor
GROUP:alpha
rigel
kent
GROUP:sparc
alshain
altair
LUMP:alphasparc
alpha
sparc
.Ed
.Pp
This example would have pollux and castor a member of no groups, rigel and
kent a member of group 'alpha', and alshain and altair a member of group 
.Sq sparc .
Note the format of the GROUP command, it is in all capital letters, followed
by a colon, and the group name.  There can be no spaces following the GROUP
command, or in the name of the group.
.Pp
There is also a LUMP command, which is identical in syntax to the GROUP
command.  This command allows you to create a named group of groups.  Each
member of the lump is the name of a group.  The LUMP command is terminated
by another LUMP or GROUP command, or the EOF marker.
.Pp
Any line beginning with a
.Sq #
symbol denotes a comment field, and the entire line will be ignored.
Note that a hash mark placed anywhere other than the first character
of a line, will be considered part of a valid hostname or command.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in clusterit 2.0.
.Sh AUTHOR
.Nm Dvt
was written by Tim Rightnour.
.Sh BUGS
Solaris 2.5.1 has a maximum of 256 open file descriptors.  This means
that
.Nm
will fail on a fanout size greater than about 32-40 nodes.
