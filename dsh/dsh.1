.Sh NAME
.Nm dsh
.Nd run a command on a cluster of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl eiq
.Op Ar -f fanout
.Op Ar -g rungroup1,...,rungroupN
.Op Ar -l username
.Op Ar -w node1,...,nodeN
.Op Ar -x node1,...,nodeN
.Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to run a command, or group of commands on a cluster of 
machines.  All commands are run in parallel, on the cluster.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl e
Unless the
.Fl e
option is specified, stderr from remote commands will not be reported to the user.
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option will list information about the current cluster, and command groupings.  It will
print out the current value of the fanout, and how many groups of machines there are within
the cluster. It will also show you which command you are about to run, and your username if
specified with the
.Fl l
option.
.It Fl q
The
.Fl q
option does not issue any commands, but displays information about the cluster, and the
fanout groupings.
.It Fl f
If the
.Fl f
option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the fanout size of the cluster.  The
fanout size is the number of nodes a command will run on in parallel at one time.  Thus
a 80 node cluster, with a fanout size of 64, would run 64 nodes in parallel, then, when
all have finished, it would execute the command on the last 16 nodes.  The fanout size
defaults to 64.  This option overrides the
.Ev FANOUT
environment variable.
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group names, the command will only be run on that group
of nodes.  A node may be a part of more than one group if desired, however running without the
.Fl g
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it appears in the
file specified by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the -w option.
.It Fl l
If the
.Fl l
option is specified, followed by a username, the commands will be run under that
userid on the remote machines.  Consideration must be taken for proper authentication, 
for this to work.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this option,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The format is the same as
the
.Fl w
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RCMD_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCMD_CMD
Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rsh
.It Ev FANOUT
When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent at once.  This can be
used to keep from overloading a small host when sending out commands in parallel.  Defaults to
64.  This environment setting can be overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.Sh FILES
The file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable has the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux
castor
GROUP:alpha
rigel
kent
GROUP:sparc
alshain
altair
.Ed
.Pp
This example would have pollux and castor a member of no groups, rigel and kent a member of group 'alpha', 
and alshain and altair a member of group 'sparc'.  Note the format of the GROUP command,
it is in all capital letters, followed by a colon, and the group name.  There can be no spaces 
following the GROUP command, or in the name of the group.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dsh hostname
.Ed
.Pp
will display:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux:	pollux
castor:	castor
.Ed
.Pp
if the file pointed to by
.Ev CLUSTER
contains:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux
castor
.Ed
.Pp
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dsh -w hadar,rigel hostname
.Ed
.Pp
will display:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hadar:	hadar
rigel:	rigel
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the
.Nm
command in IBM PSSP.
.Sh AUTHOR
.Nm Dsh
was written by Tim Rightnour.
.Sh BUGS
Error handling could use some work.
.Pp
The maximum number of nodes in a cluster is hardwired to 512.  This
can be modified by recompiling the program.
.Pp
Solaris 2.5.1 has a maximum of 256 open file descriptors.  This means
that
.Nm
will fail on a fanout size greater than about 32-40 nodes.
