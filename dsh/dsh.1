.Sh NAME
.Nm dsh
.Nd run a command on a cluster of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl eiq
.Op Ar -f fanout
.Op Ar -l username
.Op Ar -w node1,...,nodeN
.Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to run a command, or group of commands on a cluster of 
machines.  All commands are run in parallel, on the cluster.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl e
Unless the
.Fl e
option is specified, stderr will not be reported to the user, from the remote commands.
.If Fl i
The
.Fl i
option will list information about the current cluster, and command groupings.  It will
print out the current value of the fanout, and how many groups of machines there are within
the cluster. It will also show you which command you are about to run, and your username if
specified with the
.Fl l
flag.
.It Fl q
The
.Fl q
option does not issue any commands, but displays information about the cluster, and the
fanout groupings.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this flag,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RCMD_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCMD_CMD
Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rsh
.It Ev FANOUT
When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent at once.  This can be
used to keep from overloading a small host when sending out commands in parallel.  Defaults to
64.  This environment setting can be overridden by the
.Fl f
flag.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dsh hostname
.Ed
.Pp
will display:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux:	pollux
castor:	castor
.Ed
.Pp
if the file pointed to by
.Ev CLUSTER
contains:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux
castor
.Ed
.Pp
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dsh -w hadar,rigel hostname
