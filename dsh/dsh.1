.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to run a command, or group of commands on a cluster of 
machines.  All commands are run in parallel, on the cluster.  Interrupt
signals will be sent to the remote host that is currently being displayed
to the user.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl e
Unless the
.Fl e
option is specified, stderr from remote commands will not be reported to the
user.
.It Fl f
If the
.Fl f
option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the fanout size of the 
cluster.  The fanout size is the number of nodes a command will run on in 
parallel at one time.  Thus a 80 node cluster, with a fanout size of 64, 
would run 64 nodes in parallel, then, when all have finished, it would 
execute the command on the last 16 nodes.  The fanout size defaults to 64. 
This option overrides the
.Ev FANOUT
environment variable.
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group names, the 
command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A node may be a part of 
more than one group if desired, however running without the
.Fl g
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it appears in the
file specified by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option will list information about the current cluster, and command groupings. 
It will print out the current value of the fanout, and how many groups of 
machines there are within the cluster. It will also show you which command 
you are about to run, and your username if specified with the
.Fl l
option.
.It Fl l
If the
.Fl l
option is specified, followed by a username, the commands will be run under 
that userid on the remote machines.  Consideration must be taken for proper 
authentication, for this to work.
.It Fl o
The
.Fl o
option is used to set the timeout in seconds to be used when testing remote
connections.  The default is five seconds.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option can be used to set the port number that testing should occur on when
testing remote connections.  The default behavior is to guess based on the
remote command name.
.It Fl q
The
.Fl q
option does not issue any commands, but displays information about the 
cluster, and the fanout groupings.
.It Fl s
The
.Fl s
option causes
.Nm
to copy a script to the remote machine, execute it once, and delete it, all
in a single operation.  The
.Fl s
option requires a script name, which will be copied to all remote machines and
executed.  You may also optionally specify any number of additional arguments
to the script on the command line.  The script will be placed in a temporary
directory under /tmp on the remote node, executed, and then the directory will
be recursively deleted.  Any executable can be used as the script, regardless
of programming language.  The script is copied with the tar command, preserving
permissions of the original.  The
.Fl s
option cannot be used with the standard mode of
.Nm
to run other commands, nor can it be used in interactive mode.
.It Fl t
The
.Fl t
option causes
.Nm
to attempt a connection test to each node prior to attempting to run the
remote command.  If the test fails for any reason, the remote command will
not be attempted.  This can be useful when clusterfiles have suffered bitrot
and some nodes no longer exist, or might be down for maintenance.  The default
timeout is 5 seconds.  The timeout can be changed with the
.Fl o
option.
.Nm
will attempt to guess the port number of the remote service based on your
.Ev RCMD_CMD
setting.  It knows about ssh and rsh.  If
.Nm
fails to guess your port correctly, you may use the
.Fl p
argument to set the remote port number.  If the
.Ev RCMD_TEST
environment variable exists, the testing will automatically take place.
.It Fl v
Prints the version of ClusterIt to the stdout, and exits.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this option,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The format 
is the same as the
.Fl w
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is silently 
ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RCMD_TEST_TIMEOUT"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCMD_CMD
Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rsh
.It Ev RCMD_CMD_ARGS
Arguments to pass to the remote shell command.  Defaults to none.
.It Ev RCMD_PORT
The port number used to test remote connections.  See the
.Fl p
flag.
.It Ev RCMD_TEST
When set,
.Nm
will automatically test all hosts before launching the remote command. See the
.Fl t
option for more information.
.It Ev RCMD_TEST_TIMEOUT
The timeout in seconds to use when testing for remote connections.
.It Ev RCMD_USER
The username to connect to remote machines as by default.
.It Ev FANOUT
When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent at once.  
This can be used to keep from overloading a small host when sending out 
commands in parallel.  Defaults to 64.  This environment setting can be 
overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.El
.Sh FILES
The file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable has the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux
castor
GROUP:alpha
rigel
kent
GROUP:sparc
alshain
altair
LUMP:alphasparc
alpha
sparc
.Ed
.Pp
This example would have pollux and castor a member of no groups, rigel and
kent a member of group 'alpha', and alshain and altair a member of group 
.Sq sparc .
Note the format of the GROUP command, it is in all capital letters, followed
by a colon, and the group name.  There can be no spaces following the GROUP
command, or in the name of the group.
.Pp
There is also a LUMP command, which is identical in syntax to the GROUP
command.  This command allows you to create a named group of groups.  Each
member of the lump is the name of a group.  The LUMP command is terminated
by another LUMP or GROUP command, or the EOF marker.
.Pp
Any line beginning with a
.Sq #
symbol denotes a comment field, and the entire line will be ignored.
Note that a hash mark placed anywhere other than the first character
of a line, will be considered part of a valid hostname or command.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dsh hostname
.Ed
.Pp
will display:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux:	pollux
castor:	castor
.Ed
.Pp
if the file pointed to by
.Ev CLUSTER
contains:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pollux
castor
.Ed
.Pp
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dsh -w hadar,rigel hostname
.Ed
.Pp
will display:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hadar:	hadar
rigel:	rigel
.Ed
.Pp
The command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dsh -w hadar,rigel -s /bin/date
.Ed
.Pp
Will copy /bin/date to /tmp/dsh.$$ on hadar and rigel and execute it on 
each node, displaying the date and time on each remote machine, assuming
that the /bin/date you copied is a valid binary for the remote end.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the
.Nm
command in IBM PSSP.
.Sh AUTHOR
.Nm Dsh
was written by Tim Rightnour.
.Sh BUGS
Solaris 2.5.1 has a maximum of 256 open file descriptors.  This means
that
.Nm
will fail on a fanout size greater than about 32-40 nodes.
