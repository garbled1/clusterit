.Sh NAME
.Nm rseq
.Nd run a command on a cluster in sequence
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aeiqtv
.Op Fl g Ar rungroup1,...,rungroupN
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Op Fl o Ar porttimeout
.Op Fl p Ar portnum
.Op Fl w Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Op Fl x Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to run a command, or group of commands on a cluster of 
machines.  The command or commands are run on a single node in the cluster,
which is incremented in sequence on each invocation of
.Nm
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl a
The
.Fl a
option modifies the behavior of
.Nm
when dealing with stdin.  Normally 
all commands from stdin are run on the same machine.  Specifying the
.Fl a
option causes each command to be run on the next node in the seqence.
.It Fl e
Unless the
.Fl e
option is specified, stderr from remote commands will not be reported
to the user.
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option will list information about the current cluster, and command groupings.
It will also show you which command you are about to run, and your username if
specified with the
.Fl l
option.
.It Fl q
The
.Fl q
option does not issue any commands, but displays information about the cluster.
.It Fl v
Prints the version of ClusterIt to the stdout, and exits.
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group
names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A node
may be a part of more than one group if desired, however running
without the
.Fl g
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it
appears in the file specified by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl l
If the
.Fl l
option is specified, followed by a username, the commands will be run 
under that userid on the remote machines.  Consideration must be taken 
for proper authentication, for this to work.
.It Fl o
The
.Fl o
option is used to set the timeout in seconds to be used when testing remote
connections.  The default is five seconds.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option can be used to set the port number that testing should occur on when
testing remote connections.  The default behavior is to guess based on the
remote command name.
.It Fl t
The
.Fl t
option causes
.Nm
to attempt a connection test to each node prior to attempting to run the
remote command.  If the test fails for any reason, the remote command will
not be attempted.  This can be useful when clusterfiles have suffered bitrot
and some nodes no longer exist, or might be down for maintenance.  The default
timeout is 5 seconds.  The timeout can be changed with the
.Fl o
option.
.Nm
will attempt to guess the port number of the remote service based on your
.Ev RCMD_CMD
setting.  It knows about ssh and rsh.  If
.Nm
fails to guess your port correctly, you may use the
.Fl p
argument to set the remote port number.  If the
.Ev RCMD_TEST
environment variable exists, the testing will automatically take place.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this option,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The
format is the same as the
.Fl w
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is
silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RCMD_CMD_ARGS"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCMD_CMD
Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rsh
.It Ev RCMD_CMD_ARGS
Arguments to pass to the remote shell command.  Defaults to none.
.It Ev RCMD_USER
The username to connect to remote machines as by default.
.It Ev SEQ_FILE
Specifies a specific sequence file.  This is a temporary file, which 
saves the number of the last node run on.  It defaults to 
.Sq /tmp/ Ns Bo pid Bc Ns .seq .
Where
.Bq pid
is the pid of the parent process of 
.Nm seq Ns .
It may be useful to wire the
.Ev SEQ_FILE
to a particular file, in order to keep proper sequence when invoking
.Nm
from subshells or scripts.
.It Ev RCMD_PORT
The port number used to test remote connections.  See the
.Fl p
flag.
.It Ev RCMD_TEST
When set,
.Nm
will automatically test all hosts before launching the remote command. See the
.Fl t
option for more information.
.It Ev RCMD_TEST_TIMEOUT
The timeout in seconds to use when testing for remote connections.
.El

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in clusterit 1.1.
.Sh AUTHOR
.Nm Seq
was written by Tim Rightnour.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command works fine when used with the
.Fl w
and
.Fl x
flags.  However the user may find that if the arguments are changed, or
the flags are omitted on a subsequent run, the next node picked may not be
predictable.  The sequence is calculated on each invocation of
.Nm
and the sequence numbers recorded in the temporary file may not match up
to a new sequence placed on the command line.
