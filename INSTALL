On NetBSD you should simply be able to do a make followed by a make install.

Minor modifications may be necc. to work on FreeBSD, if so, please send me a
patch.

Hints for installing/compiling on various platforms.

Solaris:
If you are using gcc, simply run `patch -p 0 <make.solaris.gcc' in the
clusterit-1.3/ directory.  This will patch the Makefiles to what most likely
needs to be there to do a proper build.  Some fine tuning may be required.

AIX:
If you are using gcc, simply run `patch -p 0 <make.aix.gcc' in the
clusterit-1.3/ directory.  This will patch most of the Makefiles to what
needs to be there for a proper gcc build on AIX.

If you are using IBM C (tested with 4.4 C on AIX 4.3.2) you can use
`patch -p 0 <make.aix.ibmc' to prepare the makefiles for use with IBM C.

Please let me know if anything goes wrong with these.

After your Makefiles are in order, you should just be able to do a
make , followed by a make install.

If you patch any makefiles, or have to make any changes to these programs
to port them to another OS, please send me whatever patches you can.  I will
try to integrate as much multi-OS support as is possible.
