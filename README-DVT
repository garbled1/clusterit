I've had reports of people having trouble running dvt on various machines
and clusters.  IMHO, this is probably the second most useful peice of
clusterit, so hopefully these hints will get you started.  If not, feel
free to email me at root@garbled.net for help.  I'm usually nice.

1) Make sure that rvt is in your path, and is executable.  Try running it
manually just to make sure it works.

2) rvt/dvt default to using rlogin.  You probably want to set this to ssh.
If you aren't sure this is working, or don't want to deal with ssh, one trick
I ususally use is to set the RLOGIN_CMD environment variable to "telnet" and
just login manually.

3) Make sure you have your display set, and all that fun stuff.  If you can't
run an xterm, dvt/rvt won't work either.

If none of this helps, send me a note, perhaps I can help you with it.
