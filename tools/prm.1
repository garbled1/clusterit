.Sh NAME
.Nm prm
.Nd delete a file or files on a cluster of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfrPRW
.Op Fl g Ar nodegroup1,...,nodegroupN
.Op Fl w Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Op Fl x Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to delete files or directories on a cluster of 
machines.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this flag,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group names, the
command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A node may be a part of
more than one group if desired, however running without the
.Fl g
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it appears in the
file specified by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The format is
the same as the
.Fl w
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is silently
ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl d
Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.
.It Fl f
Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,
regardless of the file's permissions.
If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify
the exit status to reflect an error.
.It Fl P
Overwrite regular files before deleting them.
Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff,
then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.
.It Fl R
Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.
The 
.Fl R
option implies the
.Fl d
option.
.It Fl r
Equivalent to
.Fl R .
.It Fl W
Attempts to undelete the named files.
Currently, this option can only be used to recover
files covered by whiteouts.
.El
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RCMD_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCMD_CMD
Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rsh
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dsh 1 ,
.Xr rm 1 ,
.Xr rsh 1 ,
.Xr kerberos 3 ,
.Xr hosts.equiv 5 ,
.Xr rhosts 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the
.Nm
command in IBM PSSP.
.Sh AUTHOR
.Nm Prm
was written by Tim Rightnour.
.Sh BUGS
Some of the more advanced options, like the
.Fl P
option, may not be available in some versions of
.Xr rm 1 .
Consult the
.Xr rm 1
manpage on the remote host if you have problems.
