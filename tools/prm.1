.Sh NAME
.Nm prm
.Nd delete a file or files on a cluster of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfrPRW
.Op Ar -w node1,...,nodeN
.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to delete files or directories on a cluster of 
machines.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this flag,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl d
Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.
.It Fl f
Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,
regardless of the file's permissions.
If the file does not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify
the exit status to reflect an error.
.It Fl P
Overwrite regular files before deleting them.
Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff,
then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.
.It Fl R
Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.
The 
.Fl R
option implies the
.Fl d
option.
.It Fl r
Equivalent to
.Fl R .
.It Fl W
Attempts to undelete the named files.
Currently, this option can only be used to recover
files covered by whiteouts.
