.Dt CLUSTERSED 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm clustersed
.Nd quickly dissect cluster files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar clusterfile Ns | Ns -
.Ar string1 ... stringn
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to cut individual groups out of a cluster file.  This
can be used to see the contents of a particular group easily, or to
generate special-use clusters on the fly. The results of the program
will be sent to standard output.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width clusterfile
.It Ar clusterfile
The first argument must either be the name of a cluster file, or a
single dash
.Pq Sq - .
If the dash is given, the clusterfile will be read from the file
indicated in the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  If the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable does not exist,
.Nm
will process standard input.
.It Ar string
The second argument is a space separated list of one or more strings
to search for in the cluster file.  These are the names of groups
within the cluster, and will only match group names.  If a group name
is matched, all nodes in that group will be printed out, along with
the
.Sq GROUP:
heading and the name of the group.  You can partially match the
begining of a group name with a string.  For example, the argument
.Sq serv
would match
.Sq server1
and
.Sq server2
but would not match
.Sq subserv .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width "CLUSTER"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
