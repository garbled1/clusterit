.Nd format the output of dsh
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
takes input from the dsh command, and formats it to look nicer for the user.

it in a header above the output for that node.  This is generally useful for
commands that make output larger than 80 columns when prepended with the
nodename.

.Xr dsh 1 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
clusterit 1.0.  It is based on the
.Nm
command in IBM PSSP.
.Sh AUTHOR
.Nm Dshbak
was written by Tim Rightnour.
