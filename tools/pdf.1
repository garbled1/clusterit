.Sh NAME
.Nm pdf
.Nd display free disk space across a group of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl kln
.Op Fl g Ar size
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Op Ar -w node1,...,nodeN
.Op Ar file | Ar file_system ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified
.Ar file_system
or on the file system of which
.Ar file
is a part on all machines in a cluster.
If neither a file or a
.Ar file_system
operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted file systems, on all machines are displayed
(subject to the
.Fl w
,
.Fl g
,
.Fl l
and
.Fl t
options below).
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this flag,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl l
Display statistics only about mounted file systems with the MNT_LOCAL
flag set.  If a non-local file system is given as an argument, a
warning is issued and no information is given on that file system.
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the file systems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
file systems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm
will not request new statistics from the file systems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.It Fl g Ar size
Is used to limit the displayed file systems to only those with a
size greater than the user-supplied
.Ar size
argument.
.It Fl t Ar type
Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on
filesystems of the specified type.
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.Dq no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
.Em not
be taken.  If a file system is given on the command line that is not of
the specified type, a warning is issued and no information is given on
that file system.
.El
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RCMD_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCMD_CMD
Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rsh
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Nx
1.4. It is based on the
.Nm
command in IBM PSSP.

was written by Tim Rightnour for The NetBSD Foundation, Inc.
.Sh BUGS
Output is formatted for 80 columns.  This means that mount points and
filesystems with long names ( > 20 characters ) will be truncated.  In
addition, numbers longer than 9 digits will be truncated as well.
