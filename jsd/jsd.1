.Sh NAME
.Nm jsd
.Nd simple command scheduling daemon for remote execution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl iq
.Op Fl f Ar fanout
.Op Fl g Ar rungroup1,...,rungroupN
.Op Fl l Ar username
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl o Ar port
.Op Fl w Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Op Fl x Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is used to schedule remote execution of jobs across a
heterogenous cluster of machines.  Upon starting the daemon, it will
attempt to run a benchmark on all machines under it's control.
Once the daemon is active it listens for connections from a
.Em jsh
process, and gives each connecting process the name of a remote host
to execute a command on.  Faster hosts are preferred by the
.Nm
daemon, and the fastest of all remaining hosts will allways be given
out first.  Once a remote
.Em jsh
process has completed it's use of the remote host, it will again
contact the
.Nm
daemon, and return the node to service.  The daemon will never give
the same node out to more than one process at a time.
.Pp
.Nm
logs errors and critical conditions to the syslog with the facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option will list information about the current cluster, and command groupings. 
It will print out the current value of the fanout, and how many groups of 
machines there are within the cluster. It will also show you which command 
you are about to run, and your username if specified with the
.Fl l
option.
.It Fl q
The
.Fl q
option does not issue any commands, but displays information about the 
cluster, and the fanout groupings.
.It Fl f
If the
.Fl f
option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the fanout size of the 
cluster.  The fanout size is the number of nodes a command will run on in 
parallel at one time.  Thus a 80 node cluster, with a fanout size of 64, 
would run 64 nodes in parallel, then, when all have finished, it would 
execute the command on the last 16 nodes.  The fanout size defaults to 64. 
This option overrides the
.Ev FANOUT
environment variable.
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group names, the 
command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A node may be a part of 
more than one group if desired, however running without the
.Fl g
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it appears in the
file specified by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl l
If the
.Fl l
option is specified, followed by a username, the commands will be run under 
that userid on the remote machines.  Consideration must be taken for proper 
authentication, for this to work.
.It Fl o
The
.Fl o
option can be used to set the port number which jsd will listen to
requests from
.Em jsh
processes for remote nodes.  This option overrides the
.Ev JSD_OPORT
environment variable.  The default listen port is 2002.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option can be used to set the port number which jsd will listen to
replies from
.Em jsh
processes indicating completion of processing on remote nodes.  This
option overrides the
.Ev JSD_IPORT
environment variable.  The default listen port is 2001.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this option,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The format 
is the same as the
.Fl w
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is silently 
ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "JSD_BENCH_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCMD_CMD
Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rsh .
This is only used by jsd when issuing the benchmark at startup, and has no
effect on how
.Em jsh
processes will connect to the remote nodes.
.It Ev JSD_BENCH_CMD
This is the name of a command, which when run on the remote nodes of
the cluster will give some indication of the relative speed of the
machines.  It does not need to be precise.  If no benchmark command is 
specified, all machines are considered to be the same speed, and will
not be wieghted.  The bench command expects a single floating point
number as the only output to the remote command.  Larger numbers are
to indicate faster machines.  See the
.Em EXAMPLES
section for more details.
.It Ev FANOUT
When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent at once.  
This can be used to keep from overloading a small host when sending out 
commands in parallel.  Defaults to 64.  This environment setting can be 
overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.It Ev JSD_OPORT
When set, overrides the default port which jsd listens on for
.Em jsh
processes requesting nodes.  This environment setting can be overriden 
by the
.Fl o
option.
.It Ev JSD_IPORT
When set, overrides the default port which jsd listens on for
.Em jsh
processes reporting back that it has completed processing on a node.
This environment setting can be overriden
by the
.Fl p
option.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In order to generate a benchmark figure useful to
.Nm
you will most likely need to process the ouput of a benchmark command
in some way.  There are two simple ways of doing this:
.Pp
The first way is to build a script, which exists on each machine, and
run that as your benchmark command.  The below script shows how to
process the output of the
.Xr whetstone 1
command into a format useable by
.Nm :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh
 ./whetstone 100000 | grep MIPS | sed -e 's|.*: \\(.*\\) MIPS|\\1|'
.Ed
.Pp
The other way, would be to run a more involved benchmark on each
machine, (or assign numbers arbitrarily) and place them in a file on
the remote machines.  A benchmark command could then simply be
.Ic cat /etc/benchmark
or some other similar setup.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dsh 1 ,
.Xr jsh 1 ,
.Xr syslogd 8 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in clusterit 2.0.  It should be pronounced
.Qq jez-dee ,
and stands for
.So
Job Scheduling Daemon
