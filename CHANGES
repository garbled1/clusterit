Fix a bug in pcp where if the -m option was used, filesystems at 100%
would not be displayed.

Handle ^C's correctly.  If a remote process is hung, and it is the current
process being read, you may ^C it, and the interrupt will be sent to the
remote process.  This would be just like hitting ^C on the remote end, 
and will only affect the process you are currently reading from.

Added ability to pcp multiple files and wildcards to remote hosts.

Made pcp and dsh compile on an ANSI compiler (IBM C, SUN C)

Make output from dsh look nicer, and format well.

# changes since 1.2
* Release 1.2 *

Bug fixes in dsh to deal with the start of a fangroup, and
a race condition, where large output would cause it to hang
waiting for descriptors to die.

Fix a bug in dsh that caused it to lose data on AIX, and 
dump core when transitioning fangroups.

Added the rungroup, and exclusion commands to all the programs.

Fix pdf to work on a heterogenous cluster.

Add concurrency to pcp, to eliminate startup latency lossage.

Take some of the work out of the main loop in pcp, and only do it
once.  This should speed up serial copies by small amount.

Fix seq, and run to actually work.  Use a semi-atomic test and set
to create the seq file, so it actually runs through the nodes, rather
than execute on the same one over and over.

* Release 1.1 *
#no data previous to 1.1.  Sorry.
