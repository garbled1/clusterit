.Sh NAME
.Nm pcp
.Nd copy a file to a cluster of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ceprv
.Op Fl f Ar fanout
.Op Fl g Ar rungroup1,...,rungroupN
.Op Fl w Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Op Fl x Ar node1,...,nodeN
.Ar source_file1
.Op source_file2 ... source_fileN
.Op destination file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to copy a file, or directory to a group of machines.
The group of machines can be listed on the command line, or default to
the environment setting
.Ev CLUSTER
.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl c
Normally 
.Nm 
copies files serially, to all the nodes specified.  When the
.Fl c
option is used,
.Nm
will copy the files in parallel to the nodes, subject to the
.Ev FANOUT
environment setting and
.Fl f
option.  Smaller files will benefit greatly from parallel copies,
due to reduced latency in the initial authentication, and connection.
However, large files, especially on a shared ethernet, will suffer
tremendous speed degredation, because of the collisions the transfers
will create.  This effect can be reduced, by lowering the fanout size
of the cluster.
.It Fl e
Unless the
.Fl e
option is specified, output from remote commands will not be reported 
to the user.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option causes
.Nm
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Ar umask  .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar file2
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask  2
on the destination host is used.
.It Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.It Fl v
Prints the version of ClusterIt to the stdout, and exits.
.It Fl f
If the
.Fl f
option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the fanout size of 
the cluster.  The fanout size is the number of nodes a command will
run on in parallel at one time.  Thus a 80 node cluster, with a fanout 
size of 64, would run 64 nodes in parallel, then, when all have
finished, it would execute the command on the last 16 nodes.  The
fanout size defaults to 64.  This option overrides the
.Ev FANOUT
environment variable.
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group
names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A node
may be a part of more than one group if desired, however running
without the
.Fl g
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it
appears in the file specified by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this flag,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The 
format is the same as the
.Fl w
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is
silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width "RCP_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCP_CMD
Command to use to copy files to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rcp .
.It Ev RCP_CMD_ARGS
Arguments to pass to the remote copy command. Defaults to none.
.It Ev RCP_USER
The username to connect to remote machines as by default.
.It Ev FANOUT
When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent at
once.  This can be used to keep from overloading a small host when
sending out commands in parallel.  Defaults to 64.  This environment
setting can be overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.El
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
pcp file
.Pp
will copy the file 
.Sq file 
to the home directory of the current user on
all machines listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment setting.
.Pp
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
pcp -w hadar,rigel file
.Pp
will copy the file
.Sq file
to the home directory of the current user on the machines
.Sq hadar
and
.Sq rigel .
.Pp
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
pcp -w hadar,rigel /usr/bin/foo /usr/local/bin/foo
.Pp
will copy the file
.Sq /usr/bin/foo
to
.Sq /usr/local/bin/foo
on the machines
.Sq hadar
and
.Sq rigel .
.Pp
.Pp
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.
