	<p>
	  This is a collection of clustering tools, to turn your ordinary
	  everyday pile of UNIX workstations into a speedy parallel beast.
	  
	<p>
	  Initially this work was based on the work of IBM's PSSP, and copied
	  heavily from the ideas there.  Its also lightly based on the work
	  pioneered in GLUnix.  I've decided to simplify, and complexify it
	  however:
	  
	<p>
	  Glunix is a monstrosity.  It allows better control over the
	  individual nodes, and much better load sharing.  However I'm
	  convinced alot of the speed advantages of having a parallel
	  cluster are lost with the incredible overhead of running the
	  glunix master and daemon services on a host.  Glunix does
	  however offer a real parallel programming  environment.
	  Something which is totally beyond the scope of this package.
	  
	<p>
	  PSSP is also a very powerful set of tools.  Not much more than a
	  bunch of staples written in perl, they provide an incredible
	  tool for tying an unwieldy number of UNIX machines into one fast
	  demon of an MPP.
	  
	<p>
	  The advantages of both systems are central control of a large
	  number of machines.  Unfortunately, they all have drawbacks.. as
	  does my solution.

	<p>
	  What my solution provides:<br>
	<dl>
	  <dt>*Fast* parallel execution of remote commands.</DT>
	  <dd>C vs. Perl.  You do the math.</DD>	  
	  <dt>Heterogeneous cluster makeup.</dt>
	  <dd>
		This makes it very easy to administer a large number of
		machines, of varying architectures, and operating systems.
		The fact that my tools are completely architecture
		independent, make it possible to dsh commands out to machines
		that aren't even running the same OS!  This can be useful for
		a variety of mass administration tasks an admin may have to
		undertake.</dd>
	  
	  <dt>Choice of authentication.</dt>
	  <dd>
		IBM forces you to use kerberos 4 for authentication on the
		SP's. This is actually fine for a closed environment like an
		SP, but for something to be run on just a stack of otherwise
		useful boxes, you need more freedom. This suite allows you to
		do whatever you like.. ssh, kerberos, .rhosts. Whatever suits
		your security needs best.</dd>
	  
	  <dt>Sequential node, and random node execution</dt>
	  <dd>
		The idea here is that these dsh-like programs allow you to do
		something akin to load balanced scripting.  For example one
		could set up an NFS shared build directory, and issue the
		command:
	  <DD>
		<pre>
make -j4 CC="seq 'cd /usr/src/foo ; gcc'"
		</pre><br>
		Which would execute a build in parallel, on 4 nodes in your
		cluster, assigning processes to each node in sequence.   The
		run command is equivalent to saying: "I don't care where you
		run, just run and tell me how things turned out."  Generally
		speaking, the run command will achieve better results as the
		size of the cluster increases.  If you have only three nodes,
		the odds of getting the same node over and over are fairly
		good.		
	  <dt>Job sequencing</dt>
	  <dd>
		It is possible using this package to schedule processes on the 
		remote machines, so that no more than one process per machine
		is active at any one time.  This was designed to combat
		problems with using seq for paralell builds.
		<p>
		  When building in paralell with seq, it is possible that a
		  node recieves a task that will take it much longer than the
		  other nodes to complete.  It is also possible that as other
		  nodes finish thier jobs faster, the node which has been
		  bogged down is handed another job.  When performing large
		  paralell builds, eventually very slow machines will stall
		  the entire build, as they are attempting to compile many
		  objects at once, and are usually at this point near-death
		  from swapping.
		<p>
		  The Job Scheduling in ClusterIt can prevent this in two
		  ways.  First, the job scheduling will not allow a node to
		  process any more than one command at a time.  If more
		  commands than nodes are requested, the excess commands will
		  block until a node has freed up.  Second, the scheduler has
		  the ability to register a benchmark number of some sort for
		  each node.  This allows the scheduler to allways give out
		  the fastest of the remaining nodes whenever one is
		  requested.  This allows a paralell build to more efficiently 
		  utilize a heterogenous cluster.
	  </dd>
	  <Dt>Barrier sync for shell scripting.</dt>
	  <dd>
		This is a new idea.  The barrier mechanism consists of a
		daemon run on a host, and a client which can be used to
		barrier sync with.  An example of use would be:</dd>
	<pre>
#!/bin/sh
do something
barrier -h host -k token -s 5
do something else
	</pre>
	<p>
	  You would then dsh the execution of this script to your hosts.
	  The barrier makes sure that all hosts have completed the first
	  "something" before the continue on to the next something.  The
	  -s, is the level of parallelism for the script, ie: how many
	  processes to wait for before continuing.
	<DT>Distributed Virtual Terminals</DT>
	<dd>
	<p>
	  This is a parallel interactive execution environment.  The user 
	  is given windows for each host in the cluster, and a central
	  management window.  Keystrokes typed on the central management
	  window, will be relayed to all of the subordinate windows. This
	  allows the user to vi a file on 20 machines simultaneously, for
	  example.  You can also select a window, and use it like a normal
	  xterm, to perform actions on just that host.
	</p>
	</dd>
	</DL>
	<HR>
	<DL>What my solution does not provide:
	  
	  <DT>A parallel programming API</DT>
	  <DD>
		Use MPI, or PVM, or whatever for that.. thats outside the scope of
		this suite.</DD>
	</DL>
