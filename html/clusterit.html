<center><h2>Welcome to clusterit-1.1 !</center></h2>

<p>This is a collection of clustering tools, to turn your ordinary
everyday pile of UNIX workstations into a speedy parallel beast.

<p>Initially this work was based on the work of IBM's PSSP, and copied
heavily from the ideas there.  Its also lightly based on the work
pioneered in GLUnix.  I've decided to simplify, and complexify it
however:

<p>Glunix is a monstrosity.  It allows better control over the
individual nodes, and much better load sharing.  However I'm convinced
alot of the speed advantages of having a parallel cluster are lost with
the incredible overhead of running the glunix master and daemon services
on a host.  Glunix does however offer a real parallel programming
environment.  Something which is totally beyond the scope of this package.

<p>PSSP is also a very powerful set of tools.  Not much more than a bunch
of staples written in perl, they provide an incredible tool for tying
an unwieldy number of UNIX machines into one fast demon of an MPP.

<p>The advantages of both systems are central control of a large number of
machines.  Unfortunately, they all have drawbacks.. as does my solution.

What my solution provides:
<br>
<dl>
<dt>*Fast* parallel execution of remote commands.</DT>
<dd>C vs. Perl.  You do the math.</DD>

<dt>Heterogeneous cluster makeup.</dt>
<dd>This makes it very easy to administer a large number of machines,
of varying architectures, and operating systems.  The fact that my tools are
completely architecture independent, make it possible to dsh commands out
to machines that aren't even running the same OS!  This can be useful for a
variety of mass administration tasks an admin may have to undertake.</dd>

<dt>Choice of authentication.</dt>
<dd>IBM forces you to use kerberos 4 for authentication on the SP's.
This is actually fine for a closed environment like an SP, but for something
to be run on just a stack of otherwise useful boxes, you need more freedom.
This suite allows you to do whatever you like.. ssh, kerberos, .rhosts.
Whatever suits your security needs best.</dd>

<dt>Sequential node, and random node execution</dt>
<dd>The idea here is that these dsh-like programs allow you to do something
akin to load balanced scripting.  For example one could set up an NFS shared
build directory, and issue the command:<DD>
<pre>make -j4 CC="seq 'cd /usr/src/foo ; gcc'"</pre><br>
Which would execute a build in parallel, on 4 nodes in your cluster, assigning
processes to each node in sequence.   The run command is equivalent to saying:
"I don't care where you run, just run and tell me how things turned out."  Generally speaking, the run command will achieve better results as the size of the
cluster increases.  If you have only three nodes, the odds of getting the same
node over and over are fairly good.

<Dt>Barrier sync for shell scripting.</dt>
<dd>This is a new idea.  The barrier mechanism consists of a daemon run on
a host, and a client which can be used to barrier sync with.  An example of use
would be:</dd>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
do something
barrier -h host -k token -s 5
do something else
</pre>
<p>then you would dsh the execution of this script to your hosts.  The barrier makes
sure that all hosts have completed the first "something" before the continue on to
the next something.  The -s, is the level of parallelism for the script, ie: how
many processes to wait for before continuing.

<HR>
<DL>What my solution does not provide:

<DT>A parallel programming API</DT>
<DD>Use MPI, or PVM, or whatever for that.. thats outside the scope of
this suite.</DD>
</DL>
<hr>
<DL>
Things to do still:
<br>
<dt>supper</dt>
<dd>Mimic IBM's supper suite.. but do a better job of
it than big blue did.  Yuck.</dd>
