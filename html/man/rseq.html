     SYNOPSIS
     </h3>
<b>seq</b>
[<b></b><b>-aeiq</b>]
[<b></b><b>-g</b><i></i><i> rungroup1,...,rungroupN</i>]
[<b></b><b>-l</b><i></i><i> username</i>]
[<b></b><b>-w</b><i></i><i> node1,...,nodeN</i>]
[<b></b><b>-x</b><i></i><i> node1,...,nodeN</i>]
[<i></i><i>command</i><i> ...</i>]
     <h3>
     DESCRIPTION
     </h3>
The
<b>seq</b>
utility can be used to run a command, or group of commands on a cluster of
machines.  The command or commands are run on a single node in the cluster,
which is incremented in sequence on each invocation of
<b>seq</b>
The following options are available:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b></b><b>-a</b><dd>
The
<b></b><b>-a</b>
option modifies the behavior of seq when dealing with stdin.  Normally
all commands from stdin are run on the same machine.  Specifying the
<b></b><b>-a</b>
option causes each command to be run on the next node in the seqence.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-e</b><dd>
Unless the
<b></b><b>-e</b>
option is specified, stderr from remote commands will not be reported
to the user.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-i</b><dd>
The
<b></b><b>-i</b>
option will list information about the current cluster, and command groupings.
It will also show you which command you are about to run, and your username if
specified with the
<b></b><b>-l</b>
option.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-q</b><dd>
The
<b></b><b>-q</b>
option does not issue any commands, but displays information about the cluster.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-g</b><dd>
If the
<b></b><b>-g</b>
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group
names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A node
may be a part of more than one group if desired, however running
without the
<b></b><b>-g</b>
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it
appears in the file specified by the
<code></code><code>CLUSTER</code>
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
option.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-l</b><dd>
If the
<b></b><b>-l</b>
option is specified, followed by a username, the commands will be run
under that userid on the remote machines.  Consideration must be taken
for proper authentication, for this to work.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-w</b><dd>
If the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
<i></i><i>command</i>
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this option,
<b>seq</b>
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
<code></code><code>CLUSTER</code>
environment variable.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-x</b><dd>
The
<b></b><b>-x</b>
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The
format is the same as the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is
silently ignored if used with the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
option.
</dl>
     <h3>
     ENVIRONMENT
     </h3>
<b>seq</b>
utilizes the following environment variables.
<dl compact>
<p><dt><code></code><code>CLUSTER</code><dd>
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
<p><dt><code></code><code>RCMD_CMD</code><dd>
Command to use to connect to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
<b></b><b>rsh</b>
<p><dt><code></code><code>SEQ_FILE</code><dd>
Specifies a specific sequence file.  This is a temporary file, which
saves the number of the last node run on.  It defaults to
`/tmp/pid[. .seq. ]'
Where
[pid]
is the pid of the parent process of
<b>seq</b>.
It may be useful to wire the
<code></code><code>SEQ_FILE</code>
to a particular file, in order to keep proper sequence when invoking
<b>seq</b>
from subshells or scripts.
</dl>

     <h3>
     DIAGNOSTICS
     </h3>
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

     HISTORY
     </h3>
The
<b>seq</b>
command appeared in clusterit 1.1.
     <h3>
     AUTHOR
     </h3>
<b>Seq</b>
was written by Tim Rightnour.
     <h3>
     BUGS
     </h3>
The
<b>seq</b>
command works fine when used with the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
and
<b></b><b>-x</b>
flags.  However the user may find that if the arguments are changed, or
the flags are omitted on a subsequent run, the next node picked may not be
predictable.  The sequence is calculated on each invocation of
<b>seq</b>
and the sequence numbers recorded in the temporary file may not match up
to a new sequence placed on the command line.
