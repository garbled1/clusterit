     NAME

<b>pcp</b>
- copy a file to a cluster of machines
     <h3>
     SYNOPSIS
     </h3>
<b>pcp</b>
[<b></b><b>-cerp</b>]
[<b></b><b>-f</b><i></i><i> fanout</i>]
[<b></b><b>-g</b><i></i><i> rungroup1,...,rungroupN</i>]
[<b></b><b>-w</b><i></i><i> node1,...,nodeN</i>]
[<b></b><b>-x</b><i></i><i> node1,...,nodeN</i>]
<i></i><i>source_file1</i>
[source_file2 ... source_fileN]
[destination file]
     <h3>
     DESCRIPTION
     </h3>
The
<b>pcp</b>
utility can be used to copy a file, or directory to a group of machines.
The group of machines can be listed on the command line, or default to
the environment setting
<code></code><code>CLUSTER</code>
The following options are available:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b></b><b>-c</b><dd>
Normally
<b>pcp</b>
copies files serially, to all the nodes specified.  When the
<b></b><b>-c</b>
option is used,
<b>pcp</b>
will copy the files in parallel to the nodes, subject to the
<code></code><code>FANOUT</code>
environment setting and
<b></b><b>-f</b>
option.  Smaller files will benefit greatly from parallel copies,
due to reduced latency in the initial authentication, and connection.
However, large files, especially on a shared ethernet, will suffer
tremendous speed degredation, because of the collisions the transfers
will create.  This effect can be reduced, by lowering the fanout size
of the cluster.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-e</b><dd>
Unless the
<b></b><b>-e</b>
option is specified, output from remote commands will not be reported
to the user.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-p</b><dd>
The
<b></b><b>-p</b>
option causes
<b>pcp</b>
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
<i></i><i>umask</i>.
By default, the mode and owner of
<i></i><i>file2</i>
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
<code>umask(2)</code>
on the destination host is used.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-r</b><dd>
If any of the source files are directories,
<b>pcp</b>
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-f</b><dd>
If the
<b></b><b>-f</b>
option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the fanout size of
the cluster.  The fanout size is the number of nodes a command will
run on in parallel at one time.  Thus a 80 node cluster, with a fanout
size of 64, would run 64 nodes in parallel, then, when all have
finished, it would execute the command on the last 16 nodes.  The
fanout size defaults to 64.  This option overrides the
<code></code><code>FANOUT</code>
environment variable.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-g</b><dd>
If the
<b></b><b>-g</b>
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group
names, the command will only be run on that group of nodes.  A node
may be a part of more than one group if desired, however running
without the
<b></b><b>-g</b>
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it
appears in the file specified by the
<code></code><code>CLUSTER</code>
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
option.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-w</b><dd>
If the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
<i></i><i>command</i>
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this flag,
<b>pcp</b>
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
<code></code><code>CLUSTER</code>
environment variable.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-x</b><dd>
The
<b></b><b>-x</b>
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The
format is the same as the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is
silently ignored if used with the
<b></b><b>-w</b>
option.
     <h3>
     ENVIRONMENT
     </h3>
<b>pcp</b>
utilizes the following environment variables.
<dl compact>
<p><dt><code></code><code>CLUSTER</code><dd>
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
<p><dt><code></code><code>RCP_CMD</code><dd>
Command to use to copy files to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
<b></b><b>rcp</b>
<p><dt><code></code><code>FANOUT</code><dd>
When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent at
once.  This can be used to keep from overloading a small host when
sending out commands in parallel.  Defaults to 64.  This environment
setting can be overridden by the
<b></b><b>-f</b>
option.
     <h3>
     EXAMPLES
     </h3>
The command:
     <p>
pcp file
     <p>
will copy the file
`file'
to the home directory of the current user on
all machines listed in the file pointed to by the
<code></code><code>CLUSTER</code>
environment setting.
     <p>
     <p>
The command:
     <p>
pcp -w hadar,rigel file
     <p>
will copy the file
`file'
to the home directory of the current user on the machines
`hadar'
and
`rigel'.
     <p>
     <p>
The command:
     <p>
pcp -w hadar,rigel /usr/bin/foo /usr/local/bin/foo
     <p>
will copy the file
`/usr/bin/foo'
to
`/usr/local/bin/foo'
on the machines
`hadar'
and
`rigel'.

command in IBM PSSP.
